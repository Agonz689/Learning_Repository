## **Let us know what you liked or didnâ€™t like about the content of this course.**
So far I like the format of the class it is very beginner friendly as this is my 1st time using python:snake:. 
Going over examples of the code we will be using for our homework helps me to better understand the purpose of the code and 
how it can be applied in the real world. :earth_americas:	


## **What would you like to see more of?**
I would like to see more examples of python code :snake: so I can better see the difference between python and matlab or C++.
This will help me rewire my brain :brain: so I can translate my experience with other coding languages to python.

## **What would be interesting or helpful to your learning journey?**
It would be helpful to go over homework and quizzes after completed in class, to see how a more experience coder would
go about solving the problems. :desktop_computer:	:keyboard:
